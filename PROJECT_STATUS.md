This C++ Order Book project has been successfully developed, tested, and optimized. All major functionality has been implemented with comprehensive test coverage and robust memory management.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core OrderBook Functionality
- **Add Orders**: Full support for buy and sell orders with price-time priority
- **Cancel Orders**: Efficient order removal with automatic cleanup
- **Modify Orders**: Complete implementation using cancel-and-replace logic
- **Order Matching**: Sophisticated matching engine with partial fills and multi-level execution
- **Memory Management**: Proper RAII with destructors to prevent memory leaks

### Data Structures
- **PriceLevel**: Efficient FIFO order management at each price level
- **OrderBook**: Map-based price level organization for fast lookups
- **Order**: Complete order representation with all necessary fields

### Utilities
- **Thread-Safe ID Generation**: Atomic counters for order and execution IDs
- **High-Resolution Timestamps**: Microsecond precision timing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error checking and edge case handling

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Test Suites (53 tests total)
- **OrderBookTest** (22 tests): Core functionality, matching, edge cases, and ModifyOrder
- **PriceLevelTest** (13 tests): Order management, filling, and time priority
- **HelpersTest** (11 tests): ID generation, threading, and performance
- **IntegrationTest** (7 tests): Complete scenarios, stress testing, and consistency

### Test Categories
- ✅ Unit tests for all components
- ✅ Integration tests for complex scenarios
- ✅ Performance tests for high-frequency trading
- ✅ Thread safety tests for concurrent access
- ✅ Memory safety tests with sanitizers
- ✅ Edge case and error handling tests

## 🔧 Build System

### Enhanced build.sh Script
- **Multiple Build Types**: Debug, Release, and Sanitizer modes
- **Automated Testing**: Integrated test execution with detailed reporting
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer and UBSan integration
- **Developer Friendly**: Clean builds, parallel compilation, artifact reporting
